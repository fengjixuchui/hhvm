/**
 * As an unsafe extension and for the purpose of top-level migration,
 * we additionally map certain contexts to a (set of) capabilities that
 * are provided but not required by a function (i.e., they are unsafe).
 * This namespace contains mapping to such capabilities using
 * same-named contexts. More precisely, the function/method with context
 * `ctx` has the following type of capability in its body:
 *   \HH\Capabilities\ctx & \HH\Capabilities\Unsafe\ctx
 * where safe contexts have `\Unsafe\ctx = mixed`. The function signature's
 * capability remains:
 *   \HH\Capabilities\ctx
 * for the purposes of subtyping and calling.
